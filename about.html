    <div class="about-text">
      <p>I am a 16 year old North Vancouver photographer. I first started taking photos when I was 8 years old. At that time I was taking macro photos of flowers and plants. Since then, I have branched out to wildlife, landscapes and more. I am a member of the North Shore Photographic Society.</p>

      <p>I love photography because I can be creative and capture a moment in time. I often see things a little bit differently than other people, and it’s fun to share my unique perspective. I aspire to one day be a National Geographic photographer!</p>

      <p>My family has a cabin in the Chilcotin and I take a lot of photos in that area. I always bring my camera on our vacations so you’ll see photos from different places around BC, Canada and international locations.</p>

      <p>I sell my photo greeting cards at local craft markets. I can also do special orders. You can see more of my work on Instagram @a_closer_look_photo.</p>
